# Virtual-Autonomous-Driving-car-Project-


Autonomous Self-Driving Car using Machine Learning

Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation of an autonomous self-driving car using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system mimics the human brain's visual cortex to make driving decisions based on the input from onboard cameras.

Features
Real-time data processing from vehicle-mounted cameras
Advanced image recognition for immediate response to driving conditions
Data exploration and visualization using Python libraries

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Dataset
The project uses a dataset comprising images from the vehicle's cameras and corresponding steering angles. This data undergoes extensive preprocessing and augmentation to train the machine learning model effectively.

System Architecture
The system employs a CNN that takes in processed camera images and predicts the required steering angle to navigate the road. The CNN architecture is designed to automatically learn feature representation from the raw pixels of the images without manual feature extraction.

Implementation
The CNN model is trained using a dataset of driving scenarios. The training process adjusts the model weights to minimize the difference between the predicted steering command and the actual human driver command. The system uses various Python libraries for image processing and model training.

Usage
The trained model is deployed in a simulated environment where it receives real-time camera images, processes these images, and sends control commands (steering and throttle) to navigate the car autonomously.
